# cpt_billing_mix
extract, manipulate and summarize medical provider codes based on kareo output
## problem:
* this process takes about an hour to do per clinic by hand
* it is very easy to mess up
* it is critically important to understanding operations

## process:
* clean the clinicians initials and medical code columns
* build a pivot table to group the data together
* do some light math
* build a running text document to store the data in for later entry

## result:
easily understandable (for those in the field) look at clinic health and each provider within the clinics contributions to kpi.


## project history:
started in feb 2022, updated once a month or so since then.
